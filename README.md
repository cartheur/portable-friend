This code was written in Visual Studio 2005/2008 with the Windows Mobile 6 Standard SDK. In order to be able to see the code work in this original context you will need a virtual machine running Windows XP SP3 (one processor and 8GB of RAM works well) and need to install the following, in this order:

* Visual Studio 2008 (You only need the C# and Device support - see figure)
